  title: About me
  summary: |
    GCP Solutions Architect & BSc Honours Information Technology. 
    Beginning with bare-bones PHP and Linux servers, I gradually 
    transitioned into full-stack engineering. This progression has 
    given me a broader perspective when designing and implementing 
    solutions in the cloud.

    I have a strong work ethic and a keen ambition to learn anything 
    related to software. I believe my deep sense of empathy has helped 
    me approach challenges thoughtfully while upholding strong moral 
    values, regardless of external circumstances. Throughout my career, 
    I’ve had the pleasure of working with diverse teams, which has 
    enhanced my interpersonal skills and equipped me to effectively 
    navigate and resolve team-based challenges.
