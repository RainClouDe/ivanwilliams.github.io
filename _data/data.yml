  title: About me
  summary: |
    GCP Solutions Architect & BSc Honours Information Technology. 
    Beginning with bare-bones PHP and Linux servers, I gradually 
    transitioned into full-stack engineering. This progression has 
    given me a broader perspective when designing and implementing 
    solutions in the cloud.

    I have a strong work ethic and a keen ambition to learn anything 
    related to software. I believe my deep sense of empathy has helped 
    me approach challenges thoughtfully while upholding strong moral 
    values, regardless of external circumstances. Throughout my career, 
    I’ve had the pleasure of working with diverse teams, which has 
    enhanced my interpersonal skills and equipped me to effectively 
    navigate and resolve team-based challenges.

  - role: Cloud DevOps Engineer
    time: 2025 - Present
    company: Synthesis
    details: |
      At Synthesis, I worked closely with our client, Lombard, 
      where I led the migration of teams from locally developed 
      proof-of-concepts to production-ready cloud deployments 
      in under a week using Google Cloud Platform and Terraform. 
      I enhanced CI/CD pipelines with InfraCost for cost analysis
      and SonarCloud for code quality checks. Leveraging Google 
      Cloud Fabric, I helped build and manage scalable cloud 
      infrastructure.

      As part of a broader architecture, I deployed Cloud Run 
      services behind load balancers, connecting them to PostgreSQL 
      databases hosted within a VPC for secure, private access. 
      I implemented Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) to restrict 
      application access to specific organization members, 
      enhancing security. For another Synthesis client, 
      I developed a scheduled pipeline that executes on a 
      VM once a month, using custom Bash startup scripts to 
      orchestrate the process reliably.

  - role: Senior Software Engineer
    time: 2021 - 2025
    company: Loop Platform
    details: |
      Leveraging my knowledge of neural networks, I developed and 
      refined a routing algorithm based on the Travelling Salesman 
      Problem, which was later used as a proof of concept for Aramex. 
      I also utilized Pub/Sub and Cloud Functions to stream hundreds 
      to thousands of requests into BigQuery, enabling real-time 
      analytics for Loop’s clients. This data streaming system was 
      later expanded to support additional pipelines—a project I 
      led in collaboration with other developers. Additionally, 
      I built a Cloud Function that listened for location updates 
      from a Flutter app and triggered “Order is nearby” 
      notifications to clients.

      In parallel, I led and managed my team through production 
      deployments on the Loop Platform, carefully planning feature 
      rollouts to ensure zero disruption to clients. 
      I also performed a live database migration from the development 
      environment to production using the Database Migration 
      Tool, maintaining uninterrupted service while allowing 
      development to continue handling live traffic.

      I contributed to feature development for their existing 
      platform, Soko Source. When I joined, the team had a Django 
      application that required deployment to the cloud. Although 
      I had no prior experience with Kubernetes or Microsoft Azure, 
      I proactively taught myself both technologies and successfully 
      deployed the application to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). 
      Additionally, I gained valuable hands-on experience by 
      extensively working with Azure Virtual Machines.

      full-stack web development to build several frontend 
      components. I also worked on enhancing MTN’s 
      USSD menus and made updates to their existing mobile app, XLink.
